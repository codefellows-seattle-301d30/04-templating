# Lab 04: HTML Templating with HandlebarsJS

----
### Author: Peter Kim and Austin Matteson

## Overview
Focus of our efforts today was on implementing Handlebar template so that it can replace $.clone() template.  We updated Article.prototype.toHtml() method in order to utilize the Handlebars template.
In addition we made efforts on refactoring the existing functions and methods using arrow function.
