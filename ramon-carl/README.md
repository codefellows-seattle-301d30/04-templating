# Kilovolt Blog 04-Templating

**Author**: Ramon and Carl
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This is a practice project. The purpose of it is to create a fun website containing a blog with icons that are appealing to the user, and have the page be responsive so that it looks as desired on both desktop and mobile screens. The main problem domain has to do with the responsive design of this website. We want to be able to filter content by author or category, and have the menu items show the appropriate content, all on a single page using jQuery and Handlebars.

## Getting Started
The user would need to 
* Create index.html
* Get the icons from IcoMoon
* Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css
* Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats
* Add filler text
* Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology
* Include link to jQuery library (CDN)
* Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values
* Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructor's method
* Use Handlebars.js to populate html elements with article values
* Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM


## Architecture
We used HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars.js
