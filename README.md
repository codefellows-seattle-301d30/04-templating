**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This project allowed us to use handlebars.js to dynamically render articles using a template so that content can be efficiently updated. This application is a blog that filters articles by category and author. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
We forked over the starter code from the class repository and created working branches to add necessary updates for functionality including implementing handlebars and converting some functions to arrow functions.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, handlebars.js
