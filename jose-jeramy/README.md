# Lab 04: Templating with Handlebars.js

**Author**: Jose Reyes && Jeremy Crawford
**Version**: 1.0.4 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Focus of our efforts today was on replacing previous article template with a handlebars template, and on refactoring all functions using arrow functions where possible.

## Getting Started
In order to build this app, you need to get the starter-code from Allie. Once you have that, you should work order your JS files so they are referenced after previous information (i.e. data then constructor then content styling). Finally, have lunch.

## Architecture
Languages used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery
All images rendered from Brook's personal collection.
