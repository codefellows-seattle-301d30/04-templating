# Lab 04 - HTML Templating with HandlebarsJS

**Author**: Beverly Pham and Rebecca Prows
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We used handlebar template to populate our blogs. We refactored our functions where possible to use arrow functions. Bascially we made our code more dry. 

## Getting Started
Clone the code onto thier machine. Get the handlebar CRN and link it in. Refactor functions that don't have this to arrow methods. 

## Architecture
We used html and javascript. We used handlebars library.
